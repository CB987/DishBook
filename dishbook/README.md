<h1>Dishbook</h1>
<p>Dishbook is an incredible experience of international dining. Upon choosing the kind of cuisine upon which they would like to dine, users are presented with several options of dishes native to that country, and then they can look at the recipe for each dish. They can also give each recipe a "like" or "dislike" reaction.</p>

<h3>MVP</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Let users choose from an array of flag images, which routes them to...</li>
    <li>An array of recipes from the chosen country that they can choose from, which routes them to...</li>
    <li>A "recipe card" with an image, the title, and all the ingredients and instructions for the recipe</li>
    <li>The recipe card has like/ dislike buttons for users to react to the recipe.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technologies</h3>
<ul>
    <li>HTML/CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>React Router</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Versions</h3>
